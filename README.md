# Welcome!

This repository hosts my individual Data Science projects and several excercises related to courses I have being taking. 

## Prediction of Death after Heart Failure

The data in: 

Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman: Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 20, 16 (2020)

is used to predict death event after Heart failure with a single-headed Transformer. The algorithm improves some of the original prediction metrics, including a 16% imrpvement in the ROC area under curve.

## Weather in Cabella Ligure

A project to forecast the weather in Cabella Ligure. Being a city in a valey, the usual weather forecast has been unreliable. This is an attempt to improve this situation.

## Timeseries

This folder contains two main files: 
ARIMA-ATTENTION-LSTM.ipynb: A notebook exploring Bitcoin-price prediction using several LSTM-based models;
timeseries.py: A personal timeseries module designed to prepare time series data and automate their feature engeneering, especialy to apply LSTM-based networks.

More details of each project can be found in their own sections.
